# ZNS

Zer0 Name Service (ZNS) is the underlying set of Ethereum-based smart contracts responsbile for 'Global Addressing' within Zero. A global naming system is a necessary component for distributed distributed systems like Zero, where system state lives within multiple parallel systems, and does not reside in a single centralized server (cloud) or decentralized ledger (blockchain). Similar to DNS, Global Addressing enables users and communities to establish global identities and namespaces in Zero and across any part of the Internet. 

Addresses can be set to map to any type of arbitary content source. Zero loosly buckets addresses in three categories:

- **Networks** in Zero map to shared namespaces, such as a community, organization or DAO. 
- **Handles** in Zero map to individal user accounts, which can represent either humans or bots.
- **Resources** in Zero map to any type of resource, such as a binary file, url, or text blob. 

## Addressing

There are multiple namespaces in a typical address path:

- ```0://``` -> is used to singify a Zero Address
- ```0://rootaddr``` -> The first value in the address path is a pointer to the ref of the domain set by the domain's Registry Contract.
- ```0://rootaddr:subdomain``` -> The second value is a pointer to the subdomain set by the Registries corresponding Registry entry. 
- ```0://rootaddr:subdomain:content``` -> The third value is a pointer to content within the Registry entry at that location. 

## How It Works

The following is a simple overview of how the ZNS protocol works: 

- Root domains in ZNS are defined by creating Registries.
