# ZNS

Zer0 Name Service (ZNS) the underlying set of Ethereum-based smart contracts that manage 'Global Addressing' within Zero. Similar to DNS, Global Addressing enables users and communities to establish global identities and namespaces within Zero and beyond. Global Addressing is particularly necessary for distributed systems such as Zero, where data global statte does not reside in a single centralized server (cloud) or decentralized ledger (blockchain).

Addresses can be set to map to any type of arbitary content source, including but not limited to:

** Networks in Zero map to shared namespaces, such as a community, organization or DAO. 
** Handles in Zero map to individal user accounts, which can represent either humans or bots.
** Resources in Zero map to any type of resource, such as a binary file, url, or text blob. 

## Addressing

There are multiple namespaces in a typical address path:

** '0://' -> is used to singify a Zero Address
** '0://rootaddr' -> The first value in the address path is a pointer to the ref of the domain set by the domain's Registry Contract.
** '0://rootaddr:subdomain' -> The second value is a pointer to the subdomain set by the Registries corresponding Registry entry. 
** '0://rootaddr:subdomain:content' -> The third value is a pointer to content within the Registry entry at that location. 

## How It Works

The following is a simple overview of how the ZNS protocol works: 

** Root domains in ZNS are defined by creating Registries.
